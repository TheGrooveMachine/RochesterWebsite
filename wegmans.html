    <h1>Wegmans</h1>

    <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Wegmans Food Markets, Inc., is a privately held American supermarket chain; it is headquartered in Gates, New York, and was founded in 1916 in Rochester. As of May 2021, Wegmans has 106 stores in the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>A discussion of Rochesterâ€™s unique food options would be incomplete without discussing Wegmans. Although it is starting to spread into different states, Rochester 
        remains the home of the greatest grocery store 
        chain in America, Wegmans. Not only is the customer service top tier, but the food selection, as well as the prices, is enough to make anyone fall in l
        ove with this grocery store. In addition, perhaps the most attractive aspect of shopping at Wegmans is the impressive array of quality Wegmans brand products. Normally store-brand products 
        are lackluster in comparison to their on-brand siblings. However, Wegmans often surpasses its on-brand counterparts while most of the time doing so at a lower price point. </p>
