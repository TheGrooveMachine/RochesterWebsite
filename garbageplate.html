    <h1>The Garbage Plate</h1>
    <div class="paragraphs">
    <p> 
        Macaroni Salad, a cheeseburger patty, a hotdog, home fries, meat sauce, onions, and bread.
        </p>
    <p>First synthesized in 1918 by Nick Tahou, the garbage plate has made a name for itself in Rochester’s food community. Founder Alex Tahou named the eatery after his son, Nick, who ran the establishment until his death in 1997. Although the original Garbage Plate remains solely in the hands of the Nick Tahou brand, many copy-cat versions appeared some of which even surpassing their predecessor.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly the mac salad is the most important ingredient on the plate. If the mca salad is band, you have yourself a bad garbage plate. French fries are hard to mess up as long as they are salty and crispy they are easy. Of all the hundreds of garbage plates I have had in my life, the mac salad has consistently been the ingredient messed up most often. Mac salad tastes like rubber. Jimmy Zee’s on the other hand consistently produces the creamiest and rich mac salad in town. They have yet to be dethroned in any of the ingredients they produce. Their chicken tender plate HITS.</p>
