    <h1>Rochester City School District</h1>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>Like every city, Rochester does have its drawbacks. Perhaps its biggest is the lacklusteer city school system known as the RCSD. Underfunded and poorly managed, those in charge of the RCSD consistently make ill-informed and radical decisions. For example, according to the Rochester Newspaper, “RCSD superintendent proposes 236 layoffs… The layoffs are part of an effort to close a $60 million budget deficit.” The budget deficit arising from poor management. This decisions resulted in mass student and teacher protests including walk-outs. This is just one of the many examples of how the RCSD is managed.</p>
        <p>In my own experience of attending a city school, I can confidently say that they are often staffed with the kindest and best faculty and teachers around, but they are not given proper resources. They are often underpaid and offer little to no opportunities for the students. The RCSD could greatly benefit from a larger budget as well as new management.</p>
