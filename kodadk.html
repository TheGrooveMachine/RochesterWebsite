        <p>In 1880, a high school dropout named in George Eastman became one of the first americans to develop and manufacture dry plates (light-sensitive gelatin-based emulsion) on United States soil. Furthermore, the formation of his partnership with Henry Strong paved the way for further endeavors in the Kodak company. Examples include the first commercially produced roll of film, which lead Thomas Edison to developing the first motion picture camera. According to theur official website, “Kodak has earned nine Oscar® statuettes – more than any other non-studio company – for its technical contributions to the movie industry.” These are just some of the many contributions Kodak made to the world of photography, film, printing, and document imaging. </p>
        
        <p>It is not secret that Kodak today os not the same Kodak that existed 30 years ago. In the simplest of words, the reason for Kodaks fall was the introduction of the digital camera. The company did little to prepare for its influence over American consumers and simply shrugged it off by saying “But it was filmless photography, so management’s reaction was, ‘that’s cute—but don’t tell anyone about it.” Nowadays, Kodak is chiefly provides software and technology for the commercial printing market.</p>
