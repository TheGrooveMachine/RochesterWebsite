    <h1>Susan B. Anthony</h1>
    <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Advocate of abolition, rights of labor, and equal pay, Susan B. Anthony was one of the faces of the women’s suffrage movement alongsine Elizabeth Cady Stanton. After meeting William Loyd Garrison and Fredrick Douglass, who were friends of her father, she became passionate about moving to end slavery. Despite the fact that it was seen improer for women to give speeches at that time, Anthony routinely spoke out against slavery and the evils it entices. Moreover, following the ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments, which gave African American men the right to vote, they angrily formed the National Woman's Suffrage Association, as they believed it was wrong for them to exclude women from the legislation.</p>
            <p>It was not until 1872 where the Anthony’s movement garnered national attention, when she was arrested for voting. After the story quickly spread throughout the nation, the suffrage movement gained a lot of traction leading to a massive protest in 1876 where she gave a speech titled “Declaration of Rights.” Anthony continued fighting for women’s right to vote until her death in 1906, 14 years before the 19th ammendment passed giving women the right to vote in 1920.</p>
